            <h3>About the 2020 Awards</h3>
							<p>Multi-sport stars who excelled in several different areas have been recognized as Athletes of the Year by the Mountain Amateur Athletic Club.</p>
							<p>The 23 WNC Sports Awards winners - presented by Ingles - were selected by the MAAC Board of Directors from a list of 125 finalists that represent the best of Western North Carolina high-school athletics.</p>
						 	<p>The finalists in 24 categories are normally recognized and honored at the WNC Sports Awards Banquet at Omni Grove Park Inn. After the 2020 banquet was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MAAC - which has conducted the event since 1959 - chose to continue to honor the top athletes and teams.</p>
							<p>WLOS-TV will air a one-hour special on June 27 to honor the award winners. Hosts for the special will be sports anchors and MAAC board members Stan Pamfilis and Chris Womack.</p>
